<h2> History funfacts! </h2>
<p> - The church was first established in 1832 by missionaries from the Société des Missions étrangères de Paris. </p>
<p> - The dedication of the church to the Good Shepherd stems from the note written by Saint Laurent Imbert to his fellow missionaries asking them to join him in surrendering to the authorities 
to save their flocks from extermination during a period of Christian persecution in Korea. </p>
<p> - He wrote: “In desperate circumstances, the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.” They surrendered and the three of them were beheaded on 21 September 1839. 
News of this and their martyrdom reached Singapore when a name was being considered for the church and “Good Shepherd” was chosen. </p>
<p> - Today, the Cathedral houses the relics of Saint Laurent Imbert. </p>

	<u> What's so special?</u> 
</h4>

<h4> 1. The Homeless Jesus sculpture</h4>


<p>
<img src="https://cathedral.catholic.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/01/800x600_HomelessJesus.jpg" width="400" height="300">
        The Homeless Jesus sculpture is located at the Garden of Resurrection overlooking the main entrance of the Cathedral church. 
Sculpted by Canadian sculptor Timothy Schmalz, it depicts Jesus as a homeless person, sleeping on a park bench. His Face and Hands are obscured, hidden under a blanket, but crucifixion wounds on His Feet reveal His identity. 
One is reminded of what the Lord said about the Son of Man having nowhere to lay His Head: ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.’ Matthew 8:20
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The scupture further challenge us to ponder on the saying, ‘In truth I tell you, in so far as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me.’ Matthew 25:40
</p>
<p>The sculpture was a donation to Archbishop William Goh. He blessed it on Christmas Day, 25 December 2016. </p>
<br>

<h4> 2. The Christmas Angels</h4>

<p> The Christmas Angels are light sculptures that are placed around the internal perimeter of the garden, and is on display during the Christmas season. At night, it is a beautiful sight and lights up the garden in a unique way. Take a prayerful walk around the Cathedral compound (especially in the evening).
</p>
<p> You are in the company of Angels in choir. Reflect on the presence of God in our lives through His angels.

<h4> 3. A statue of Saint Pope John Paul II </h4>
<img src="https://cathedral.catholic.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/JP2.jpg" "width="400" height="300" >

<p> The statue of Saint Pope John Paul II is located next to the Garden of Resurrection. The statute is holding a sceptre in its left hand. Its other hand is gesturing in the air. A bush of birds of paradise and palm tree can be seen behind the statute. 
The statue was placed in the grounds after John Paul II paid a pastoral visit to Singapore in 1986. </p>

“I plead with you – never, ever give up on hope, never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” -JP II
